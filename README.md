# Spartan OS
Spartan OS is an Operating System developed as a Final Year Project for
the Bachelor of Science (Hons) in Software Development at Limerick Institute of Technology
    http://www.lit.ie/Courses/LC233/default.aspx

Spartan OS is a Multi-Tasking 32-bit Protected Mode Operating System featuring
a Graphical User Interface with file associations and is designed with usability in mind.
Spartan OS uses an in-memory file system (Ram Disk), and has drivers for the PC Speaker,
the Serial Port and the PS/2 keyboard and mouse.

This repository contains the software implementation, the research and design documentation.
