
 VESA BIOS EXTENSIONS (VBE) driver for the Spartan OS

 The VESA standard provides high resolution video modes which are
 implemented as memory mapped pixel buffers. This is convenient for
 an operating system.

 This driver privides access to the video frame buffer through a pipe
 which is copied to video memory during the vertical blanking period.
